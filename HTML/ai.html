        <h2>Bugsy Background</h2>
        <p>For this project, I reimagined the original Elizabot as a programming assistant called Bugsy. Instead of pretending to be a therapist, Bugsy acts like a helpful, slightly chaotic coding buddy who's always ready to debug, encourage, and throw in a few jokes along the way.</p>
        <p>I chose this idea mainly because I'm not a super creative person — I tend to think more practically. Coming up with a programming assistant just made sense to me. I also thought it would be interesting to look back on Bugsy a few years from now, once I'm deeper into programming, and see how much my struggles and mistakes have changed over time.</p>
        <p>To build it, I edited the elizadata.js file heavily. I rewrote the initial greetings and final messages to fit Bugsy’s personality — friendly, sarcastic, and full of programmer humor. I replaced the original Eliza keywords with a ton of coding-related topics like "python," "API," "syntax error," and "framework," and I also added casual keywords like "hello," "hi," "ok," and "thanks" so Bugsy could respond more naturally. For some of the old Eliza triggers like "sorry" and "dream," I kept the basic idea but added a funny twist where Bugsy accidentally slips into therapy mode before snapping back to coding.</p>
        <p>Overall, Bugsy is meant to be a much more casual, funny, and programming-aware version of Eliza — and something I'm actually excited to keep around as a snapshot of where I started.</p>
