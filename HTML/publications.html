    <p>John Oliver's segment on data brokers from Last Week Tonight highlighted how personal data is collected, traded, and used without most people realizing it. One of the examples in the video was about a single man being shown ads relating to new dads after buying a singular bottle of baby oil with his credit card. This shows how easily incorrect assumptions can be made and how those mistakes stick, regardless of how accurate they are.</p>
    <p>The most surprising takeaway was how little regulation exists in the U.S. to govern these data brokers. Companies can gather and sell personal information without much oversight, leaving people with little to no control over how their data is handled. Once your information enters these networks, itâ€™s basically impossible to know where it goes or who has access to it. This lack of accountability undermines our privacy as consumers and makes it difficult to trust how our personal data is used.</p>
    <p>The segment made me reflect about how vulnerable our digital identities are and how much stronger privacy protections are needed. While individual steps like adjusting app permissions or using privacy tools can help, broader changes, like stricter regulations, are necessary to protect our individual privacy rights.</p>
