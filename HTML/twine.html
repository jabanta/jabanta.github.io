      <p>I created <em style="color:#0f0"> You Should’ve Read the Fine Print</em> to explore how digital convenience often comes at the cost of agency, privacy, and awareness. The game is built around a simple question: “What happens when you don’t pay attention?” From device settings to everyday notifications, I wanted to show how the smallest decisions — or non-decisions — accumulate. Instead of creating a dystopian world, I stuck with reality. Because, in many ways, it already feels like one.</p>
      <p>Working in Twine gave me a better appreciation for interactive storytelling. I learned how to track variables, create branching logic, and subtly guide players without forcing them. It taught me how choice can be used not just to drive a plot, but to reflect a mindset. I also learned how easy it is to accidentally write too linearly — or make paths too similar — and how much iteration it takes to make even a short story feel reactive and responsive.</p>
      <p>It was genuinely satisfying to see the logic come together — when a choice changed a stat and then quietly influenced what scenes would appear later. Building something that responds to player behavior, even in small ways, felt meaningful. Writing the branching endings and giving players subtle nudges without being preachy was a fun balancing act. I also enjoyed embedding social commentary in everyday digital interactions, rather than making it too abstract or heavy-handed.</p>
      <p>Referencing the Consumer Rights Wiki proved more difficult than expected. The wiki is relatively new, and many of its subpages are still incomplete, so I wasn’t able to link to it as often or as cleanly as I’d hoped. Additionally, there were technical frustrations — particularly with CSS and Twine’s macro syntax. Some macros (like (set:)) caused formatting quirks I couldn’t always cleanly solve, and responsive design in the web iframe version took more time than I wanted.</p>
      <p>Honestly, I’m not entirely satisfied with the game’s current state. There are areas where I wish I had gone deeper — more consequences for your choices, more subtle callbacks, a few extra surprise interactions. But as with any time limitations, a line has to be drawn. In a later version, I’d refine the variable interactions, add more dynamic middle scenes, and clean up the visual presentation further. I’d also like to integrate better educational links when appropriate, assuming those resources become more robust.</p>
