        <h2>Hobbies</h2>
        <p> My main hobbies are focused around messing with computers both inside and out. On the hardware side of things, I enjoy fiddling with any piece of tech I can get my hands on. Software wise I am of course a Cyber major. More specifically, I taught myself to code with Autohotkey back when it was allowed for the game I play (the developers banned the use entirely as players were of course testing the limits with the implemented rule "1 key to 1 click ratio"). The game in questions is <a href="https://oldschool.runescape.com/"> Old School Runescape</a>. </p>
